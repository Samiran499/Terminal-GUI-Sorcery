This repo contains some of my small projects with Ncurses.

I started the Terminatari_Breakout on day 2 of learning Ncurses. It took 5 hours to make the base code for the game. The readability of the code is terrible. But, it's still one of the projects I had the most fun with. So, please consider checking it out.

I suggest installing ncurses on linux

Run

`sudo apt install ncurses-dev`

And while compiling link ncurses

`gcc Terminatari_Breakout.cpp -lncurses -o Terminatari_Breakout`

And then run the compiled file
